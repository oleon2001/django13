## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Report templates
reports_reporttemplate
  - name, description, report_type, format
  - template_data (JSON), is_active
  - created_by, created_at, updated_at

-- Report executions
reports_reportexecution
  - template, executed_by, parameters (JSON)
  - status, result_file, error_message
  - started_at, completed_at, created_at

-- Specific report types
reports_ticketreport
reports_statisticsreport
reports_peoplecountreport
reports_alarmreport
```

## API Usage Examples

### Generate a Statistics Report
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/reports/generate/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "report_type": "stats",
    "device_id": 1,
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-01-31",
    "format": "pdf"
  }'
```

### Get Available Reports
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/reports/available/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Get Device Reports
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/reports/device/1/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Admin Interface

The reports system includes a comprehensive Django admin interface:

- **ReportTemplateAdmin**: Manage report templates
- **ReportExecutionAdmin**: Monitor report executions
- **TicketReportAdmin**: View financial reports
- **StatisticsReportAdmin**: View device statistics
- **PeopleCountReportAdmin**: View passenger data
- **AlarmReportAdmin**: View alarm reports

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **User-Specific Data**: Reports are filtered by user permissions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and logging

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for large datasets
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
- **Async Processing**: Background task processing for large reports
- **File Management**: Efficient file storage and retrieval
