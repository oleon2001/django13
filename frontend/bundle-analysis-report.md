- **Total**: 1026KB (1MB)

## Performance Score
**Performance Score: 60/100**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Score < 80)
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes
- [ ] Add lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Optimize imports (use specific imports instead of full libraries)

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Implement React.lazy() for route components
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- [ ] Consider using lighter alternatives:
  - Replace moment.js with date-fns (if used)
  - Use lodash-es instead of lodash
  - Consider lighter UI libraries for specific components
- [ ] Implement tree shaking
- [ ] Use webpack-bundle-analyzer regularly
- [ ] Set up bundle size monitoring in CI/CD

### Code Splitting Strategy
1. **Route-based splitting**: Split each page into its own chunk
2. **Feature-based splitting**: Split large features (maps, reports)
3. **Vendor splitting**: Separate vendor libraries from app code
4. **Async component loading**: Load components only when needed

### Files to Review
- Check build/static/js/ for large chunks
- Review package.json for unused dependencies
- Analyze source-map-explorer output for optimization opportunities

## Tools Used
- webpack-bundle-analyzer
- source-map-explorer
- Custom bundle size analysis

## Next Steps
1. Review bundle-analysis.html for detailed breakdown
2. Run webpack-bundle-analyzer on port 8888 for interactive analysis
3. Implement recommended optimizations
4. Re-run analysis to measure improvements
